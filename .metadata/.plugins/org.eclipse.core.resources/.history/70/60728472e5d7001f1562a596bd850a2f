	<h2>CSS</h2>
	<p>
		Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
		specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
		markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
		SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
		Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3] CSS is designed to enable
		the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
		and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since
		the content can be written without concern for its presentation;
		provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
		presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
		formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
		which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
		enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
		between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
